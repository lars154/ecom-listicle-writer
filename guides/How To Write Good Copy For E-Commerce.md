# How To Write Good Copy For E-Commerce

Write clean, not just well: When you write copy for mobile, try to make sure it fits evenly across lines. You don’t want one word hanging on a new line by itself; it’s not easy on the eyes. If it’s not easy on the eyes, you create reason for people to skip it.

Use UX to illustrate your copy: The more you can arrange copy within a design, the faster a site visitor can comprehend it. On the homepage of AG1 and IM8 Health, you’ll see price comparisons/breakdowns designed in a way that allows your brain to process it faster.

Ladder your copy to a single emotion and punchline: Write down the emotion you want someone to feel + the punchline for them to understand at the top of a document. Then when you write your ad, website, email or landing page copy, you can ensure that it all ladders back to those two starting thoughts.

Make CTAs fun: Never use “Learn more” or “Buy Now” or anything generic for your CTAs across the website pages. CTA copy should always encourage customers to move down the funnel in their thinking, or on to the next step. “Pick my color” or “Explore best sellers” are examples of CTAs that help you get to the next step, and know what it is.

Speak to benefits, not features: Value props like “Weighted hand-knit fabric” is a feature, but benefits are how your product changes the customer's life. “Fall asleep faster, easier,” or “The feeling of a never-ending hug” sounds more illustrative. Highlight benefits at a fifth-grade reading level. Make it concise and obvious.

Keep the copy short and punchy: Use brief sentences and simple words. Short, snappy copy is easier to read and keeps people engaged. See?

Use active voice: Speak directly and confidently. "Our serum clears acne fast" is stronger and clearer than "acne is cleared fast by our serum." Active voice makes your copy more impactful. What you say, people will believe. Avoid fancy buzzwords or insider terms. Use plain, simple language that anyone in your audience can understand without effort.

Write like you talk: Maintain a conversational tone as if you're chatting with a friend. This builds trust and your brand. If your brand is well-known, readers should hear your brand voice in their head as they read.

Tell a story: Weave in narratives to emotionally connect. Incorporate your founding story or customer’s own stories/testimonials into your copy.

Explain your "why" everywhere: Every ad, email, or text should remind people why your brand exists and the problem you solve. Brands that consistently communicate their purpose at every touchpoint turn more heads (and wallets).

Make it share-worthy: Create content your audience would screenshot and send to a friend or talk about over dinner. If your emails or posts only contain a sales pitch, you're missing the chance to engage and inspire.

Leverage social proof: Use customer testimonials, reviews, or press quotes to build trust. Pick proof that resonates with your target demo. The social proof source should be familiar with the audience you’re targeting, and the selected excerpt should reinforce the key benefit you promise.

Address objections upfront: Don't wait for customers to wonder or have doubts. Proactively answer common questions or hesitations in your copy. By handling concerns early, you reduce reasons not to buy.

Create urgency: When you’re running sales, give readers a reason to act now. Mention deadlines or limited availability to inject FOMO and push for immediate action.

Hook them with a question: Start your ad or headline with an intriguing question or a relatable problem. Getting a consumer to nod along and think "I've wondered that too..." is an instant attention-grabber that boosts CTRs.

Show what they're missing: Great ads often teach the reader why they're missing out by not being your customer. Paint the picture of the problem without your product, then offer the solution (think the Jolie water report). When done right, it’s more effective than any graphic.

Use numbers and "how-tos": In headlines, "how to" promises and list numbers (especially odd numbers like 7 or 11) tend to draw interest (not sure why, but thank you Buzzfeed!).

Don't confuse with inconsistent funnel messaging: Make sure the message that got the click (your ad copy) continues on the landing page. If your ad talks about solving dry skin, the landing page should immediately continue that story and not start a whole new topic.

Design for quick scans: Format copy so it’s easy to skim. Use bold headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Assume the reader is a grandmother on an old iPhone, with bad internet. They should grasp key points even if they only glance over your text (and illustrations!).

Test, learn, and iterate: Never assume your first copy is the best. A/B test different headlines, body copy, and CTAs continuously. Let the data inform what wording actually drives more clicks or sales, then refine and repeat.

The best sales copy is like a slippery slope that you slowly fall down. The words suck you right in.

This week you'll learn a few ways to do that.

The top thing I want you to learn in today’s lesson: **Make your writing sing.**

**Give it rhythm!**

Your first assignment is my favorite non-obvious example of sales copy.

In 2015 (before he was canceled) Louis CK self-released a comedy album.

His sales page was a [simple blog post](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u8xmw220h9ulqkq6i3hr5ok744fg/kkhmh6h84pqx24cl/aHR0cDovL3dlYi5hcmNoaXZlLm9yZy93ZWIvMjAxNjAxMDkxNzM3MTUvaHR0cHM6Ly9sb3Vpc2NrLm5ldC9wdXJjaGFzZS9saXZlLWF0LXRoZS1jb21lZHktc3RvcmU=). And it was a masterpiece in writing in a simple and engaging way in order to sell!

(This post has since been taken down. I found it doing some detective work. You're welcome.)

- Dry yet intriguing.
- He uses simple language.
- The flow is beautiful. His writing sings!
- He uses self-deprecation and honesty that sells
- And his rhythm is poetic.

Am I gushing over this simple post too much? Not at all. You’ll see for yourself.

And before you get to it...below is another lovely example. No need to copy - just read.

**Your assignment: [Louis CK Sales Page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u8xmw220h9ulqkq6i3hr5ok744fg/3ohphkhqm9zn5rcr/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2IvdlVwTVNGd0JnNVR4SFJ5bjNEeExTOQ==)**

Copy that. By hand.

Many copy nerds (like me) think Gary Halbert was the greatest sales copywriter ever.

His long-form sales pages sold hundreds of millions of dollars of products ranging from health products to picture frames.

Back then (in the 70s and 80s), when Halbert was active, a company would buy a list of thousands of home addresses who they hoped fit a certain demographic.

**Then they'd hire a copywriter like Halbert. His job was simple (but hard):** with just a piece of paper, an envelope, and a stamp, use copy that convinced a housewife to buy a vacuum, or a set of knives, or a $50 calculator watch.

Imagine that. Copy so great that people mailed back a check because of a random letter sent to their home.

The man knew how to sell.

Unfortunately, in the 1980s, Halbert was sentenced to imprisonment for tax fraud. Basically, he sold millions of dollars of a product and didn't send it out after accepting money (funny, but wrong).

While in prison he wrote a series of letters to his son.

The letters told his son how to be a man, what to expect in life, and how to be a great copywriter.

They’re wonderful to read ([they're free](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/38ulzx6pposduxkek5frh5d9ronna7/58hvh7h5le7dk5f6/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb3JnYW5jcm96aWVyLmNvbS9ib3Jvbi1sZXR0ZXJzLw==)).

Today’s assignment is one of Halbert's letters to his son.

**Today's takeaway: AIDA.**

AIDA stands for **a**ttention, **i**nterest, **d**esire, **a**ction.

This is the most common format for sales pages.

Your copy, until you know what you’re doing, should be in this format.

When writing a new sales page, literally write out A, I, D, A on a blank page. Then, write within that template.

It'll work.

**So, today's assignment: [Day 2 - Halbert AIDA Letter](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/38ulzx6pposduxkek5frh5d9ronna7/25h2hoh7n5dp42a3/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2IvZmRNY3c5UERLQk5OcmdzN2FMa2g2UA==)**

**PS:** Notice how it says "Hemingway Score" on the top left of each PDF? I'll explain what that means tomorrow.

*"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another.”*

Ben Franklin said that. It's such a famous quote, psychologists named it The Ben Franklin effect.

It means a person who has already performed a favor for you is more likely to do you another favor. They’re bought in.

For example, a politician wants huge signs planted in the front lawns of everyone in town.

The best way to achieve this is asking homeowners to put a small sign in their window.

A week later, they come back asking to put a big sign in the yard. People are more likely to say yes (this is a famous, proven case study).

This idea of getting people bought in works with copywriting.

Copywriters call this “the slippery slope.”

Your goal as a copywriter is to get readers to fall down a slippery slope.

The goal of your first sentence: get people to read the second sentence.

The goal of the third: get people to read the fourth. And so on.

Readers will keep reading in proportion to the amount they’ve already read. And the more they read, the more they’ll agree with you.

Like a lot of our assignments, today’s isn’t *supposed* to be a sales letter. But it is.

The writer is Joel Spolsky. He founded StackOverflow, Trello, and a few other huge startups.

He also has a blog and it's full of beautiful, lyrical writing.

The following is a LOVELY example of creating a slippery slope.

It's a blog post called [*The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code*](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduow4z887t8ue3gwmblhn5g6kkku4/n2hohvhn2wk43qt6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9lbG9uc29mdHdhcmUuY29tLzIwMDAvMDgvMDkvdGhlLWpvZWwtdGVzdC0xMi1zdGVwcy10by1iZXR0ZXItY29kZS8=).

Joel’s not selling a product, but he is trying to convince the reader of a better way to code.

However, if you used this post to sell a coding course...it’d be the perfect beginning to a sales page.

**Your assignment: [Day 3 - Joel's Blog Post](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduow4z887t8ue3gwmblhn5g6kkku4/reh8hohqk9ep0lu2/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2IvVmVSa3J6RXdqTEFyQ2dLY2thbVRM)**

**By the way:** The upper left of each assignment has a Hemingway Score. [Hemingway App](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduow4z887t8ue3gwmblhn5g6kkku4/m2h7h5ho2k7x8rbm/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZW1pbmd3YXlhcHAuY29tLw==) is a free app that makes your writing simple. We'll talk about this more. But you'll notice that most of our examples are written at a 6th grade reading level.

Warren Buffet writes an annual shareholder letter explaining what’s happening in Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.

It's pretty complicated stuff. Imagine trying to explain how a $100 billion insurance company works!

However, with 50 years worth of letters, Buffett’s writing has stayed simple. Very simple. He averages less than 25 words per sentence and writes at a 4th grade reading level.

Why?

Because simple works.

But there's bad news.

You likely don’t write simply. Most don’t. Schools train us to write flowery language and minimum word counts.

That doesn't mean long pages are bad. The opposite is true (in most cases). Long copy sells better than short copy.

**However, you must write simply and your copy should be *just* long enough to cause the reader to take the action that you request.**

If you need long copy in order to sell effectively, use long copy.

Some products, like a can of Coke, don't need long copy. Other stuff, like a $1,000 course taught by a no-name person, needs a lot of words.

The sales page for Amazon's Kindle, one of the most well known products and brands in the world, is ~1,400 words. And that doesn't include the tens of thousands of reviews, pictures and videos.

So, remember: your copy needs to be long enough to sell and always written in simple language.

In today's lesson you'll learn how to:

1. stop using useless words
2. sound more powerful

To help you, look at the top left of the PDFs for each report I send.

They’re from a a free web app called [Hemingway](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u5l30ee7fmud3ed3cmhmx96444hl/8ghqhohgwe454qik/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZW1pbmd3YXlhcHAuY29tLw==). It tells you the reading level of your copy. I think Hemingway is oversimplified, but it does a wonderful job of teaching people how to write simply.

You’ll notice that for the most of this course the examples are in the 6th to 8th grade reading level.

For you, always write out AIDA when writing a sales page. Then, put it in Hemingway to edit.

**Today’s assignment is a double header:**

You’ll learn why, and how, you should write simply.

It doesn’t get any better than this.

Today’s assignment is one of the most famous sales letters ever.

This advertisement ran continuously, with minor changes, for twenty eight years from 1975 to 2003. And this style of storytelling was used since the early 1900s.

This letter sold over $2 billion worth of subscriptions for the WSJ. That’s roughly $200,000 a day for over 25 years. Other than minor price edits, it ran mostly unchanged the entire time.

Just two pages long, it was the workhorse for the Wall Street Journal.

Here’s what you should learn:

1. Storytelling is an amazing way to grab people’s attention and get them interested. Stories are the best way to create a slippery slope.
2. Starting a sales letter with a story…and THEN selling…is a great way to sell. Storytelling can be the Attention and the Interest in AIDA.
3. After storytelling, explain the facts of the offer (Desire) and tell the Action.

I’ve made millions using this format.

A few examples:

1. I made ~$1.5m sending an email launching Trends: [The Market Talks](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uweml776f2udg9qkazhqk4v666bn/m2h7h5ho2gpk2pbm/aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2ZpbGUvZC8xVkxCYnh0LVZtZDdvS05CSFZiZ2duNVNMUVFTbDhpZEQvdmlldz91c3A9c2hhcmluZw==)
2. The first [Trends.co](http://trends.co/) landing page had a story about Jeff Bezos: [Petri dish](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uweml776f2udg9qkazhqk4v666bn/e0hph7hkmpg9m8t8/aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2ZpbGUvZC8xd0tNazlRdFFzZ0hQRnREeWVoLWVpRkZyQk9Zel9rYWMvdmlldz91c3A9c2hhcmluZw==)
3. I made millions in ticket sales for Hustle Con. Most our sales came from email marketing and all the emails started with stories: [You can find all the early emails in this post](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uweml776f2udg9qkazhqk4v666bn/7qh7h8h0dk7vdncz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV2YmxvZy5jb20vaHVzdGxlY29uLTIwMTQv).
4. Even the landing page for THIS course has a story: [CopyThat](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uweml776f2udg9qkazhqk4v666bn/25h2hoh2v9gn7qt3/Y29weXRoYXQuY29t)

After reading today’s assignment, you’ll likely recognize it throughout the Internet. So many people copy it because it’s just that good.

So, without further ado, for today’s assignment please write out the greatest sales copy every written.

**PS:** See you Monday for Day 6!

“If you were starting a business today, what would it be?”

I loathe that question! It’s a stupid, no good, stinkin’ ask that people DM me daily on Twitter.

It’s a useless question because there are a hundred good and true answers.

Instead, what they should ask is “what skillset do you wish you acquired earlier in your career?”

My answer is easy: copywriting. More specifically, I wish I were told earlier: “write like you speak.”

Remember your 9th grade English class? “Be descriptive,” your teacher hammered into your head.

And so, you started using words like “evident” instead of “obvious.”

And sentences like “The tall muscular man took the beautiful girl’s slender hand and kissed it with his luscious full lips, until her wild beating heart fluttered with emotion.”

Oy vey!

Have you ever spoken the word “luscious” in your entire life?

And as you get older, this habit takes over your professional life. Just look at people’s bios on LinkedIn.

Procured. Utilized. Exceptional.

People do this because they think it makes them sound smart. But it doesn’t. This style of language commits the biggest sin of all: being basic!

So, today’s takeaway is this: **Write like you speak.**

Great copywriting, or really any writing for that matter, should use everyday language that sounds like it's coming straight from your mouth.

Your goal is to use the written word to get your ideas into your reader’s brain and get them to take the action you want them to take.

This means that proper grammar isn’t the most important part of your writing (a lot of people don’t realize this). And sounding smart and important with big words - that’s for losers.

Today’s example of this is one of my favorite copywriting techniques: **letter from the founder.**

Jason Fried founded a popular email business called HEY. On the sales homepage, he wrote a wonderful letter from his personal perspective on why HEY is different and worth the user’s money.

This is a wonderful sales technique that’s underused on a lot of websites and startups.

So, get to it...[Hey.com](http://hey.com/) homepage letter!

**Your assignment: [Day 6 - HEY Homepage](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zlu0d76ggxt7u5g59xbph29lx000h6/reh8hohqk7x83mf2/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2Ivd3dIMW9VR3hWRVZxbVdLWHBUeUxFSA==)**

I once made a bet with a designer co-worker of mine. We were designing a landing page for a $300/year product and we made a bet on which of us could get a higher conversion rate.

Her page was typical of most San Francisco startups. Bright colors. Cute but vague phrases and tag lines. Short copy. Very “pretty.”

Mine was only copy. Black text and a white background. It was ugly. But it told a story, was interesting, addressed objections, and informed the buyer.

She made fun of me. She said it looked like stupid Internet market-y stuff and that no one would buy it.

We spent $1000 over 2 days on Facebook ads and drove the traffic equally to each page.

My page made $3,000. Hers, only $300.

Most people think exactly like my co-worker!

But, they’re wrong!

Why?

**Because your copy needs to be long enough to achieve your desired action.**

Sometimes that means long copy, sometimes that means short. This is hard for people to understand because when looking at different landing pages people will skim a long one and say “this is too long, no one will read this!”

Nonsense.

Your goal isn’t to get everyone to read and buy. It’s to get the *right* person to read and buy.

Imagine a sales page that promises to alleviate pain caused by a rare health disorder. Most people don’t care about that. They’ll ignore. But the potential buyers, so long as you create a slippery slope, will read every word. And buy.

So here’s a terribly oversimplified rule to live by (and eventually break)

1. Longer copy is better for unknown, expensive products.
2. Shorter copy is better for well known or cheaper products.

For example, imagine you're selling a $5,000 “increase your vertical jump” program.

A link to a buy now button is pretty much all that’d be needed if Michael Jordan were the creator!

Now compare this to if I, a 30-something thicc boy dork, sold the same thing.

One *might* need a little more sales copy to convince people to buy…

Another example is the Kindle [sales page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvun3od776h6u2r637fmhevxdqqqb3/3ohphkhqx9dv5ohr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaW5kbGUtTm93LXdpdGgtQnVpbHQtaW4tRnJvbnQtTGlnaHQvZHAvQjA3OTc4SjU5Ny9yZWY9c3JfMV8xP2NyaWQ9M0xFMkowTjA0N1kxQyZrZXl3b3Jkcz1raW5kbGUmcWlkPTE2NDQ4OTcyNzUmc3ByZWZpeD1raW5kbGUlMkNhcHMlMkMxMTYmc3I9OC0x). It has about 2,500 words. This doesn’t include all the pictures, videos, or 50,000 reviews.

We’re talking about Amazon here. And the Kindle. Both of which just about everyone in America knows. And yet, there’s a lot of copy needed to sell it.

The one takeaway you should have today is that **your copy needs to be long enough to achieve your desired action.** Not shorter or longer. The only goal is to get people to act. That’s it.

Today’s assignment is 3 of my favorite short-form ads from Rolex. These are great examples for anyone who owns an e-commerce store. You can steal these ideas for the product descriptions.

1. **The Magic Of The Rolex Oyster Case** - A simple and effective way of explaining to anyone what’s special about the oyster case and why you should buy a Rolex Submariner Date.
2. **Exploring The Matterhorn** - Created in 1966, this ad could still work today.
3. **The Influence Of James Bond** - Probably the most iconic Rolex ad ever created for the most iconic luxury watch in history.

And important point: notice how these ads have amazing photography. A picture really is worth a thousand words when it comes to sales copy. Same with video. A great video or picture can, sometimes, replace a large amount of copy.

Groupon used to have the most amazing [email unsubscribe page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qulr34vvps8u3eevzi6hrdx7444un/7qh7h8h0dmk6n4fz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj10bzV6bndzN212VSZhYl9jaGFubmVsPUtyaXN0aW5hU2xhZGU=) I’ve ever seen.

When Groupon users opted out of their email list, they were sent to a page that read:

*“We’re sorry to see you go. How sorry? Well, we want to introduce you to Derrick - he’s the guy who thought you’d enjoy receiving the Daily Groupon email.”*

Then there was a video of someone fake throwing hot coffee into Derrick’s face and yelling at him—followed by a “make Derrick happy again an re-subscribe” button.

---

How beautiful is that?

As Groupon grew and appealed to more people, they toned it down a bit. That’s fair. But this premise could still work.

Often, the 2nd most viewed page on a website is the “About Us” page. And yet, when companies think about sales copywriting, they only think about landing pages.

The About Us page, unsubscribe page, product descriptions, and a few other categories are what I call “forgotten copy.”

This copy is often forgotten. And most of the time the copy is (gasp!) default copy from the software. Like a generic unsubscribe page from Mailchimp.

You should know by now that great copywriting grabs your attention and gets you to fall down the slippery slope.

That happens through the AIDA formula, storytelling, and conversational writing.

But grabbing people’s attention is also done by making the forgotten copy wonderful.

In today’s assignment, I want you to copy two different pages:

The first is the welcome email I wrote for The Hustle. When users signed up for The Hustle, they got this email. Dozens of blogs wrote about it. Admittedly, it was heavily inspired by another company called CD Baby. **Assignment 1: Copy [The Hustle Welcome Email](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qulr34vvps8u3eevzi6hrdx7444un/owhkhqh4x7k6q4bv/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2IvZThoakR6S1NTbVVLSlRrd1pvbTdTeg==).**

In 1966, two researchers wanted to answer a powerful question:

**“How can a person be induced to do something he would rather not do?”**

To start, they called two groups of people.

They asked Group 1 if a researcher could go to their home and examine their household product brands and usage.

They asked Group 2 an easier question: What type of household cleaning products do you use?

Then, a week later, they called Group 2 back again and asked them if researcher could go to their home to examine their household product brands.

The results: Group 2 was 135% more likely to let a researcher come to their home.

This study isn’t a fluke. Researchers have studied this in different cultures and scenarios.

And the takeaway is this: **a person who’s said yes to a small request first is more likely to say yes to a bigger request later–versus asking the bigger request straight away.**

I call this the Yes Ladder.

So how do you apply this with your copy?

Get people to say yes early and often in your sales copy. And if you do that well, they’re more likely to say yes to your bigger request: buying your product.

And how do you get them to say yes?

Say it with me: E-M-P-A-T-H-Y.

It’s called specific knowledge. When writing copy, take the the time to understand the customer and product.

Know why people are frustrated with the problem and the competition. Put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Find out what motivates them, what they dislike, and the root emotion that’ll make them buy.

This isn’t tough to do, but it does take time. Read Twitter. Look at message boards, Reddit, and reviews of other products. Cold call people.

For today’s assignment, I’ve found one of my favorite modern examples of this.

Marie Poulin sells a $799 course on how to use Notion (a powerful but complex todo list) to increase productivity.

The [sales page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vul7nqwwgsguv0wz2ulhw973555fn/vqh3hrhp29qo3kfg/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIuYXJjaGl2ZS5vcmcvd2ViLzIwMjIwNzA2MjE0NDQxL2h0dHBzOi8vbm90aW9ubWFzdGVyeS5jb20v) is beautiful, both in terms of copy and design.

If you’ve ever used Notion, you’ll see how well she got you to say yes.

Also notice: her page is full of testimonials and social proof. Over 35 examples. You can never have too much.

Some of you are going to be angry after reading this, and I understand why.

You know those ads you see at the bottom of Fox News and CNN article?

Often, they’re telling you about a stock that might be the next Amazon or another big promise like that.

These are called advertorials.

Basically, they look like a normal articles but they’re really sales pages. They tell you a story, get you bought in and at the bottom say something like “if you’re interested, click here to sign up.”

I’ve got a friend who made $20 million in 2 weeks running a successful advertorial.

---

There are two companies that are world class at this.

The first is Motley Fool. They sell financial newsletters. And honestly, their stock picks are really great. But a lot of people hate their marketing. They *love* advertorials, many of which are pretty aggressive. But, from a business perspective, it works. Last I heard, they make $500m a year.

And then there’s Agora. You’ve likely never heard of them. They own dozens of different brands, most of which sell financial newsletters but also supplements and all types of crazy stuff.

They’re highly unethical, recently [getting sued](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/vqh3hrhnmkoo2rug/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnRjLmdvdi9uZXdzLWV2ZW50cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIxLzAyL3B1Ymxpc2hlci13aWxsLXBheS1tb3JlLTItbWlsbGlvbi1zZXR0bGUtZnRjLWNoYXJnZXMtaXQtdGFyZ2V0ZWQ=) for selling a diabetes “cure”.

But…again, they successfully use advertorials. They make around $1.5 billion (!) a year this way.

So, why am I telling you this.

1. Because advertorials work. You can do them ethically. They work because they make readers feel emotion. More on that in a second.
2. And I’ve written a few of these. Some of which have made tens of millions of dollars.

In 2016, while running The Hustle, one of our advertisers wanted to try an advertorial. So, using what I knew about copywriting, I wrote one.

The result was this article: [Getting Called “Sweetie” Helped this Entrepreneur Create a Multi-Million-Dollar Business](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/l2hehmhoqkll59c6/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVodXN0bGUuY28vaGludC1pcy1tdWx0aS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1idXNpbmVzcy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1TaGFybWErQnJhbmRzK09mZmljaWFsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPVRoZStjYW1wYWlnbit0aGF0K2Jyb2tlK1RoZUh1c3RsZXMrd2Vic2l0ZSslN0MrMTAuMTcuMjAyMSslMjhVM3cyNVAlMjkmX2t4PUg5MW15VFRDaFI1M1BTcmI0OGl6cXdkY1ZjbXV6NGV5ZTY5WG11bFZJdFJDZ0Q4U3JfX2hrZWRISjVXaG11bVguU1FheThj)

I wrote a story about how Kara Goldin was mocked by Coke execs when she founded a water company called Hint.

The advertorial was a hit. Hint was making hundreds of thousands of dollars A DAY. We’d both post the article on our Facebook pages and they’d buy ads on Facebook and drive traffic to it. Hell, a Hint employee [wrote about the success of it](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/m2h7h5ho2n33k6sm/aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzbGV0dGVyZXN0LmNvbS9tZXNzYWdlLzc0NzQ3L0hvdy1JLXdlbnQtZnJvbS04MC1uZXctY3VzdG9tZXJzLXRvLTUwMDAtcGVyLWRheQ==) and it helped them keep their job!

Because of the success of that advertorial, we did a few more.

Another favorite was a story about my friend Jenn’s watch company, Linjer ([here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/dpheh0hqd7eezlim/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVodXN0bGUuY28vbGluamVyLWRpc3J1cHRzLTE5Yi13YXRjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS8=)).

But my point in all this is this:

**Great copywriting and sales pages have one thing in common…they make you feel a certain emotion!**

And advertorials are, in my opinion, a beautiful example of this principle.

And I get it…often, these are totally scammy. But they don’t have to be. Mine weren’t. Another [great example is how Chubbies does this](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/qvh8h7hr4g540mfl/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIuYXJjaGl2ZS5vcmcvd2ViLzIwMjIxMDAzMjIyMjI4L2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNodWJiaWVzc2hvcnRzLmNvbS9wYWdlcy90aGUtbWFuaWZlc3RvLTItMA==). It's great!

The takeaway is this: when writing sales pages, advertorials, or anything else meant to sell…use emotion.

Write your copy like you’re writing an episode of *Succession*. Have a main character, a hero’s journey, a plot, ups and downs.

This will help you stand out, and most of all, get the sale.

For your last assignment, **copy my [Hint advertorial](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u5xneoo6fqumwve0h6h7o4eggghl/7qh7h8h0d499vxfz/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5maWxla2l0Y2RuLmNvbS9kLzZQWFRxQ013TUE2ZlhlYm1mUjhqR2IvdFYzdjc3aWhRRFc5Z3hCd1BrcEZjeg==)**.

# 📝 Alex Hormozi's Copywriting Playbook

*Based on the YouTube Video Interview*

## 1. THE WRITING ENVIRONMENT

**Set up for deep work:**

- Caffeine first ☕
- Earplugs + headphones (double protection)
- Close all windows
- **Only write on days with 6+ hours uninterrupted**
- Zero meetings on writing days
- Don't have anything later that creates mental "open loops"

> "I want to be able to lose myself in the writing and come up for air whenever I want."
> 

## 2. THE STRUCTURE FORMULA

Every piece of copy/content should follow this structure:

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Story/Narrative** | Gives context and color to the concept |
| **2. Short Description** | Define what you're talking about |
| **3. Plentiful Examples** | Concrete proof and application |
| **4. Visual Framework** | Ties everything together memorably |

## 3. THE VALIDITY + UTILITY TEST

Before including ANY idea, run it through this filter:

### ✅ VALIDITY: Is it TRUE?

- In how many situations is it true?
- Can you break the model? Find an exception?
- If you can't break it → it's valid

### ✅ UTILITY: Is it USEFUL?

- Does it change someone's behavior?
- Can they operationalize it?
- If they can't DO something with it → cut it

> "If I can't clearly define what someone DOES as a result, I either need to break it down more or just cut it."
> 

## 4. THE "PAINT COAT" EDITING METHOD

Alex writes **10-19 drafts**. Here's the process:

```
Draft 1: Get everything out as fast as possible
Draft 2-5: Add "coats of paint" - refine
Draft 6-10: CRUNCH IT DOWN
Draft 11+: Socialize with readers, get feedback
```

### The Crunching Questions:

1. Can I use **fewer words**?
2. Can I use **simpler words**?
3. Would removing this **materially detract** from the substance?

If NO to #3 → DELETE IT.

## 5. THE GOLDEN RULES OF COPY

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Short words** | Maximum comprehension |
| **Short sentences** | Easier to read |
| **Big promises** | Captures attention |
| **No adverbs** | Find a better verb instead |
| **Rhythm: Short, short, long** | Creates flow |
| **Lower grade language** | More people understand it |

> "I want maximum comprehension rather than maximum word concision."
> 

**Tools:** Use **Hemingway App** for real-time feedback. Use **X/Twitter** to practice forced concision.

## 6. HEADLINE/HOOK TESTING

Alex AB tested extensively for his book. Key findings:

### What Won:

- **"Leads"** beat "Advertising," "Promotion," "Marketing"
- **"Strangers"** beat "More people"
- **"How to get strangers..."** beat "Get strangers..." (70/30!)
- **WITHOUT "more"** beat WITH "more" (71/29!)

### The Insight:

> "People want the OUTPUT, not the activity. No one wants to advertise—people want LEADS."
> 

### Test These Elements:

1. Main title/headline
2. Image/visual
3. Subhead
4. First 30-60 seconds (for video)

## 7. 🔥 "PAIN IS THE PITCH" — The Core Copywriting Secret

### Two Persuasion Weapons:

1. **Promise** → More good stuff
2. **Pain** → Less bad stuff

### The Key Insight:

> "Make an offer at the point of greatest DEPRIVATION, not the point of greatest satisfaction."
> 

### How to Write Pain-Based Copy:

**Step 1: Capture SPECIFIC painful moments**

- Not "she was overweight"
- But: *"She wore a coverall to the beach. She got chafing between her thighs walking all day. She stood in the second row of every photo because she hated having her picture taken."*

**Step 2: Use THEIR language**

- Describe the pain in the exact words your prospect uses
- The more specific you are, the more credible you become

**Step 3: The Magic Result**

> "If you can accurately describe a prospect's pain in their own language, in their own experiences, you can persuade them to buy whatever your product is... I don't have to make a promise if I can describe the pain so acutely."
> 

## 8. BULLET WRITING (For Sales Pages/Back Covers)

### The Formula:

**Take each chapter/section → Translate into the BENEFIT**

### Examples from the book:

| Chapter Topic | Bullet Version |
| --- | --- |
| Warm Outreach | "The easiest way to get another five customers tomorrow" |
| Content | "The hook-retain-reward system" |
| Paid Ads | "The 6-part ad framework that gets more people—especially strangers—to want what you sell" |

### What Makes Bullets Work:

- **Specificity** → "6-part framework" not "a framework"
- **Concrete numbers** → Creates credibility
- **Blind curiosity** → Give benefit without revealing the "how"

## 9. THE MECE FRAMEWORK

**M**utually **E**xclusive, **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive

When creating frameworks or breaking down problems:

✅ **Collectively Exhaustive:** Covers ALL options ✅ **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlap between options

**Example:** Content strategy options:

- Do **MORE**
- Do **BETTER**
- Do **DIFFERENT**

*There's no content improvement that isn't one of these three.*

## 10. THE 10X WORK = 100X RESULTS PRINCIPLE

> "The difference between gold medal and fourth place is small. The practical difference is ENORMOUS."
> 

### Why This Matters for Copy:

- 95% of people only see the beginning and the end
- Champions are made in the "mundane middle"
- The 16th coat of paint makes it exceptional
- **If people saw how much work went in, they wouldn't think it's special**

### The Litmus Test:

> "How you launch a book determines how good you are at marketing. How well the book sells TWO YEARS LATER determines how good the book is."
> 

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST

Before publishing ANY copy:

- [ ]  
    
    Did I outline/structure FIRST?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Is every idea both VALID and USEFUL?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Did I crunch it down to minimum words?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Are words simple (5th grade level)?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Short sentences with rhythm?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Did I capture specific PAIN moments?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Is the pain in THEIR language?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Are my bullets specific with numbers/frameworks?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Did I test the headline/hook?
    
- [ ]  
    
    Would I put in 10 more drafts?
    

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

> "I only talk about what you DO. By talking that way, it demystifies a lot of it."
> 

**The ultimate filter:** Does this change someone's behavior? If not, cut it. If yes, make it as clear and simple as humanly possible.
