| 45 | and a happy, healthy gut. It’s a delicious way to show your digestive system some love. |
| 46 | * |
| 47 | 4. It tastes like your favorite coffee, not a protein shake |

| 49 | real |
| 50 | 100% arabica coffee! |
| 51 | Our unique formula |
| 52 | gives you all of the same flavor, texture, and aroma that you’d normally get when ordering or making your favorite coffee. No more chalky, gritty, or dull tasting protein shakes! |

| 58 | shops each year. Skip the café lines, save both time and cash, and elevate your iced coffee game with Javvy Coffee today! |

| 60 | Make your favorite coffees right from home with just one scoop mixed into water or your favorite milk (mylk). Personalize your coffee by adding any of your other favorite ingredients and enjoy — we suggest our low-sugar flavored syrups of course! |
| 61 | 7. You can avoid mid morning crash and enjoy long lasting mental clarity |
| 62 | The caffeine gives you an initial energy boost, while the protein ensures a |
| 63 | stable |
| 64 | and lasting source of energy. |

| 66 | synergy helps maintain |
| 67 | steady energy |
| 68 | levels without the jitters or crash |
| 69 | associated with high-caffeine beverages. |
| 70 | * |
| 71 | 8. It helps you consume 20% more protein during the day on average |
| 72 | Starting your day with this protein coffee means you’ll have already met 20% of your daily protein needs before lunchtime. |

| 1 | 5 Reasons Why Fitness Coach Kelsey Heenan Loves Create |
| 2 | Creatine isn't just for the guys - learn why certified trainer and nutrition coach Kelsey Heenan recommends Create gummies for all of her clients and takes them herself - plus, save up to 42% to try for yourself! |

| 8 | 22,000+ Five-Star Reviews |
| 9 | 1. They're made with Creapure®, the highest- quality creatine monohydrate in the world. |
| 10 | As a fitness coach and nutrition expert, Kelsey Heenan only recommends what works—and that’s Create. Every gummy is made with Creapure®, the most studied, safe, and effective form of creatine for boosting cellular energy (ATP) to power your workouts and your day. |
| 15 | Create is vegan, non-GMO, made in the USA, and never compromises on quality. |
| 16 | 2. They're delicious and travel-friendly. |
| 17 | Traditional powders? Chalky, messy, and a pain to travel with. As a certified trainer and nutrition coach, Kelsey Heenan needed something better for her on-the-go lifestyle. |
| 19 | That’s why she chooses Core Gummies—delicious, portable creatine in five crave-worthy flavors: Orange, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry, Sour Green Apple, and NEW Sour Cherry. |
| 23 | Just grab, go, and fuel up—at the gym, on the road, or wherever life takes you. |
| 24 | 3. Creatine can be even more beneficial for women than men. |
| 25 | While often associated with bulking bros, creatine can be even more impactful for women—supporting strength, focus, and energy, especially during hormonal shifts. |
| 26 | It also aids recovery, boosts bone density, and supports joint health —areas where women need extra care. |
| 29 | Better yet, doses under 10g/day carry little to no risk of bloating. Just clean energy and real results. |
| 30 | 1.00 |
| 31 | 4. Creatine is one of the most scientifically studied supplements out there. |
| 32 | Creatine efficacy has been proven in tens of thousands of research studies over the last few decades. There's especially promising research around creatine benefits for women, backed by the most prominent creatine researchers in the world like Dr. Abbie Smith- Ryan. |
| 37 | One major study showed positive effects of supplementation including, but not limited to, mood, cognition, exercise performance, and body composition*. |
| 41 | *Nutrients, Published 3/8/2021, Abbie Smith-Ryan, Hannah E Cabre, Joan M Eckerson, and Darren G. Candow |

| 6 | 1. You feel tired all the time |
| 7 | Tired, even after a full night’s sleep? |
| 8 | You might be low on cellular energy. Creatine helps replenish ATP, your body’s main energy source, to keep you going strong. |
| 9 | It’s even been shown to boost performance under sleep deprivation —so you can fight fatigue and stay sharp, all day long. |
| 13 | 2. Your muscles are sore and your recovery is slow |
| 16 | Sore muscles slowing you down? |
| 17 | Creatine supports muscle hydration and repair, helping reduce soreness and inflammation. |
| 18 | With consistent use, you’ll recover faster—so you can get back to doing what you love, pain-free. |
| 19 | 3. Your workouts feel flat and sluggish |
| 20 | Your muscles might be low on quick-access energy. Creatine boosts ATP production, giving you the power, strength, and endurance to push past limits. |
| 24 | Whether you’re lifting, sprinting, or cycling, creatine helps you train harder and see results faster. |
| 28 | 4. You have daily brain fog |
| 29 | Your brain runs on energy too—and creatine helps power it. By boosting brain energy metabolism, creatine supports focus, memory, and mental clarity. |
| 33 | Recent studies show it can enhance everything from test performance to long-term cognitive health. Stay sharp. Stay ready. |

| 1 | 10 Reasons to ditch drugstore deodorant for sweat care |
| 2 | Learn about Superior Sweat Defense with Carpe |
| 3 | By Jess H. |
| 4 | Last Updated Oct. 20, 2025 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | Drugstore deodorants still leave you sweaty and smelly |
| 7 | Here’s a fun fact: Odor comes from sweat, yet most traditional deodorants don’t actually target sweat. Carpe tackles sweat by using sweat-preventing and sweat-absorbing ingredients. Combatting sweat makes these products extremely effective against body odor, too. |
| 8 | 2 |
| 9 | Big deodorant brands don't understand your sweat struggle |
| 10 | Sometimes you want to sweat, and sometimes you don’t. Carpe’s co-Founders know exactly what it’s like to sweat more than you want to. After creating a hand lotion to combat their own sweaty hands, Carpe has expanded to make sweat and odor products for all of the places we sweat but wish we didn’t. |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | They only have products for the underarms |
| 13 | Carpe is leading the charge on innovating new sweat products. The line of products has grown to include a sweat absorbing makeup primer with SPF to a dry shampoo - both of these products were inspired by customer suggestions. Within the next year, Carpe is planning to launch four new sweat-fighting products! |
| 14 | 4 |
| 15 | You don't want a single product for all of your sweaty parts |
| 16 | The skin under your pits is different from the skin on your face, so why would we want one product for the entire body? Carpe has crafted each individual sweat and odor product to be sensitive and effective for specific areas of the body. Wherever you sweat, Carpe can help. |
| 17 | 5 |
| 18 | You want to rock any color in your closet |
| 19 | To all of those shirts shoved into the back of your closet for fear of sweat stains - it’s your time to shine! Sweat stains will be the last thing on your mind when you add Carpe to your routine. |

| 30 | It's time for tried and tested products |
| 31 | Dermatologists often see patients that are looking for a safe and effective way to manage their sweat and odor. Carpe has worked extensively with researchers and dermatologists to create science-backed formulas. |
| 32 | 7 |
| 33 | You're done with irritation |
| 34 | No one wants to trade sweaty and smelly pits for itchy ones. Everyone’s body is different, so Carpe’s formulas use simple and safe ingredients that are designed to be both effective and non-irritating, even for sensitive skin. |
| 35 | 8 |
| 36 | They're just not worth the hassle and price |
| 37 | Without painful needles or invasive treatments, you can add Carpe to your daily routine from the comfort of your own home for a fraction of the cost. Carpe is a more accessible and affordable option that doesn’t require a prescription. |
| 38 | The more you know: Injections that stop underarm sweat and odor can cost nearly $1,000 per visit! |
| 39 | 9 |
| 40 | The same old scents are boring and gross |
| 41 | Carpe’s underarm antiperspirant comes in 9 luxurious perfume- and cologne-quality scents. If you want a sweet but woodsy scent, go for Sandalwood. Get that fresh out of the shower smell with Fresh Powder. If fragrance isn’t your jam, Carpe has a fragrance free version for you, too! |
| 42 | 10 |
| 43 | You shouldn't spend on what doesn't work for you |
| 44 | Carpe knows what it’s like to try every option on the shelves and still come up short. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by giving Carpe a go. Carpe is confident that you will love the formulas, but they’ve got your back with a full refund if you’re unsatisfied for any reason. |

| 2 | 10 Reasons Harvard-Endorsed Barefoot Shoes Prevent Foot Surgery & Restore Mobility |
| 3 | By Hannah Brown |
| 4 | Fed Up with Uncomfortable Shoes? You Won’t Want to Miss This Game-Changer! |
| 5 | Fortunately, a revolutionary barefoot shoe, endorsed by Harvard University, is helping people beat the statistics and even avoid foot surgery. |
| 6 | 1. Easy To Clean |
| 7 | Hike Footwear shoes are composed of a lightweight, breathable synthetic material. Cleaning them is as simple as wiping them down with a damp cloth. However, wild stains, such as mud and dirt, can be challenging to remove at times. Luckily, the Hike Footwear shoes are machine-washable! |
| 9 | If you follow these instructions, your shoes will stay away from bacteria and odors. |
| 10 | Recommended: 4.8 |
| 12 | HF Cloud Barefoot Shoes |

| 18 | 2. Slip-Resistant Traction Grip |
| 19 | One of the major hazards when walking or running outdoors are accidental trips, slips, and falls. |
| 24 | You could sustain a major injury if you fall on a hard surface. This is why it's critical to purchase slip-resistant shoes, which will significantly lower your risk of sliding or falling on slippery surfaces. |
| 26 | The Hike Footwear Shoes have a strong rubber slip-resistant traction grip that will keep you stable on your feet regardless of any liquid on the ground. |
| 32 | 3. Comfortable For The Whole Day |
| 33 | Walk up to 12 hours with ZERO foot pain. The bottom of the shoe is as comfortable as walking on a cloud! The material of the Hike Footwear Shoes provides a cloud-like comfort that helps melt the foot pain away fast. It's the perfect shoe for those people or on-field workers who are required to stand all day. |
| 40 | 4. Helps With Plantar Fasciitis & Bunions |
| 41 | Live Pain Free! The premium insoles and arch support help minimize common foot pain, plantar fasciitis, heel pain, bone spurs, fallen arches, neuropathy and more. The barefoot insole aids in the improvement of your alignment and posture for natural comfort and a healthier body. |
| 50 | 5. Good Arch Support |
| 51 | Our shoes include premium barefoot insoles with anatomical arch support to realign the foot and body, reducing discomfort from the toes to the heels, knees, hips, and lower back. |

| 57 | “The best shoes I've ever had period! The level of comfort these shoes offer is unparalleled. The minimalist design doesn't compromise on support. I've noticed a significant improvement in my posture and overall foot health since making the switch.” |
| 61 | - Lisa G. |
| 62 | 6. Wide Toe-Box |
| 63 | This barefoot shoe features a wide toe box that provides ample room for the toes to move and spread naturally. |
| 64 | This design can help reduce pressure and discomfort in the toe area, making it ideal for individuals with conditions such as bunions, hammertoes, or other foot issues that require extra room. |
| 69 | 7. 3x More Lightweight Than Any Other Shoe |
| 70 | The appeal of lightweight shoes is simple: they provide superior running performance and a more easy sensation. Carrying less weight on your feet can reduce your energy expenditure while also improving your form and biomechanics. |
| 71 | Our shoes are perfect for men and women who have jobs that require them to be on their feet all the time. Conserving energy is important during long shifts. |
| 76 | 8. Doctor-Recommended Shoes! |
| 77 | Experts of the industry have been praising our shoes for the last couple of months. Many have recommended us to their friends and families. |
| 82 | One special advocate for the barefoot shoes from hike footwear is a senior woman who suffered from plantar fasciitis, Jennifer Emerson. |
| 83 | "My pain started 10 years ago. I used to suffer for days, sometimes weeks. Foot pain really makes your life much more difficult. I would wake up during the middle of the night due to my foot pain. Then, the headaches started... I tried all the alternative treatments. Physical therapy. Acupuncture. Vitamins. Supplements. I WISH Hike Footwear was around back then..." |

| 30 | These pots inspire me... |
| 31 | "I have all the pots and pans. I’ve put them in my will to go to my children when I die, that is how much I love them.” |
| 32 | Pamela H. |
| 33 | A must buy! |
| 34 | “These pans are phenomenal. They are attractive, heavy-duty, and extremely functional. So far, everything that has been cooked in our HexClad cookware has slid right out with no sticking, unlike the nonstick set we’ve replaced. I wish these would have been available when we bought our first set. They are the best pans and creations even before sliced bread. The cost might make you second guess yourself whether you really need them. You will regret not buying them! |
| 35 | Charles P. |
| 36 | The best cookware for me! |
| 37 | "I’ve had my 12pc HexClad set for nearly 3 weeks and I absolutely love them! They show no sign of use whatsoever. They are seriously different from other nonstick cookware I’ve ever had – sturdy and solid like iron, but SO much easier to clean.. Yes, they are pricey, but you get what you pay for." |

| 2 | 5 Ways WTF Will Change the Way You Think About Foundation |
| 3 | Over 11,000 5-Star Reviews |
| 4 | 1. Flawless Look, Barely-There Feel |
| 6 | Wish your skin looked naturally even and radiant without piling on product? WTF smooths out redness and dark spots without settling into lines or clinging to dry spots. It’s that "no-makeup makeup" look everyone’s after - without feeling like you’re wearing anything at all. |
| 7 | “So Silky!” |
| 8 | “So silky, soft, light and smooth. I never feel like I’m wearing foundation. It blends like magic ! I’ve tried MANY foundations. Will never use anything else again. A beautiful and dewey young look for this 58 year old.” |
| 9 | Lauri G. |
| 10 | Verified Buyer |
| 11 | 2. Shade Matching That Actually Works |
| 13 | Finding your perfect match online can be tricky - we get it. That’s why we made it simple. Just use your Face Pencil shade and the chart below to find your perfect WTF match or take our quiz to get a natural finish that actually looks like your skin. |
| 14 | “Amazing!” |
| 15 | "A little truly goes a long way with this one. Love how it blends well, keeps face moisturized and adds a very natural glow.” |
| 16 | Anneka A. |
| 17 | Verified Buyer |
| 18 | FIND MY SHADE |
| 19 | 1.00 |
| 20 | 3. Foundation That Acts Like Skincare |
| 22 | If traditional foundations feel too dry, too flat, or accentuate every line - meet the one that doesn’t. WTF blends like skincare, hydrates like a dream, and leaves you with a healthy, natural-looking glow. |
| 23 | “Must Have!” |
| 24 | “Love this foundation - will definitely continue to reorder. It has a light to medium coverage that perfectly blurs any imperfections, but still looks natural and feels moisturizing to wear.” |
| 25 | Kylene A. |
| 26 | Verified Buyer |
| 27 | 4. Made for Real Women, by the Woman Who Gets It |
| 29 | This isn’t just another foundation. It’s the result of decades of real beauty know-how from Bobbi Brown - designed for real skin, real women, and real life. You’ll see the difference from the first swipe. |
| 30 | “Best Foundation For Mature Skin!” |
| 31 | “This is the only foundation I have found that feels and looks dewy on my 60 year old skin. All others look cakey and emphasize all my lines and pores. I love this product!” |
| 32 | Kat W. |
| 33 | Verified Buyer |
| 34 | 5. The Only Foundation That Doesn’t Feel Like One |
| 36 | No more tight, dry, or sticky foundation. WTF is rich and creamy, but still lightweight - leaving skin soft, bouncy, and radiant. For many, you can even skip your moisturizer altogether. If your skin gets drier with age, WTF is your new go-to. |
| 37 | “Moisturizing, Natural Finish!” |
| 38 | “Love this product. Coverage is very natural, and the moisturizing formula feels great on my dry skin.” |

| 1 | If you’re always running late, this ONE TOOL will not only replace your razor, waxing kit and shaving cream but also save you tons of shaving time! |
| 9 | If you’re always running late, this Eraser is your new best friend— designed to work on dry skin with no need for water or shaving cream. Just 10 minutes once a week for silky-smooth skin, anytime, anywhere |

| 11 | reason 01 |
| 12 | No, your skin’s not supposed to look like that—blame your razor! Nood’s Eraser ends strawberry skin for good |
| 18 | Razors remove hair, but they’re known for leaving behind rough, bumpy skin—a struggle anyone with strawberry skin or KP knows well (and if you don’t, consider yourself lucky!). |
| 21 | With advanced micro-etched crystal technology, The Eraser gently buffs away hair and exfoliates dead skin cells, smoothing bumps and rough texture that razors can’t fix. |
| 22 | Its fine crystal surface breaks hair at the top layer, leaving your skin smooth and strawberry skin-free. |

| 26 | reason 02 |
| 27 | Date-ready skin? 👀💦 |
| 28 | Nood’s Eraser wipes out razor bumps and ingrowns anywhere hair grows. |
| 32 | Ready for close encounters? Razor bumps and ingrown hairs can make anyone feel self- conscious—especially when it’s time to get close. |
| 33 | Nood’s Eraser makes hair removal effortless—just gentle circular motions leave your legs, arms, back, or booty bump-free and smooth, ready for any moment. |

| 1 | In Partnership with Grüns |
| 2 | September 4, 2025 |
| 3 | I Tried the Grüns Gummies Everyone’s Talking About – Here’s My Honest Review |
| Number | Start Here |
| 3 | As a beauty writer, former dancer, and mom of two, I eat clean, whole foods and try to stay consistent with my wellness routine. But despite my nutrient-rich diet (sweet potatoes, kale, grilled chicken, and the works), I learned the hard way: modern diets actually aren’t cutting it. |
| 4 | That realization led me to Grüns , which helps amplify my everyday nutrition in just a handful of teensy green gummy bears. Because even a multivitamin doesn’t pack the punch of their combined superfoods. |

| 6 | , which helps amplify my everyday nutrition in just a handful of teensy green gummy bears. Because even a multivitamin |
| 7 | doesn’t pack the punch of their combined superfoods. |
| 8 | It Helped Beat the Bloat  |
| 9 | I eat clean, but bloat still creeps in sometimes and when it does, it throws everything off. Since starting Grüns, I’ve noticed my digestion is way more regular and my stomach feels flatter throughout the day. Let’s just say… things are moving smoothly. The combo of prebiotics and gut-friendly ingredients gets two thumbs up from me. |
| 14 | No More Mid-Day Crashes |
| 15 | I work from home, which means I’m extra vulnerable to the dreaded afternoon slump. Before Grüns, I’d crash after lunch and fantasize about naps instead of finishing deadlines. Now? No slump. No caffeine crash. Just steady, sustained energy thanks to ingredients like B vitamins, thiamine, and nutrient-dense superfoods that actually do something. |

| 20 | I’m Focused AF |
| 21 | Between laundry, dishes, ballet signups, and writing deadlines, mental clarity is everything and Grüns delivers. I used to take Lion’s Mane and mushroom drinks for focus, but Grüns is easier, cheaper, and honestly more effective for me. With ingredients like mushrooms, folate, and thiamine, I’m sharper, faster, and not losing hours to distractions (or dishwasher detours). |

| 27 | I used to rotate between packets, pills, powders, and even pricey mushroom drinks. Grüns simplified all of it. Each serving includes whole veggies and fruits, vitamins, minerals, adaptogens, mushrooms, and prebiotics, all in one. They’re also third-party tested for absorption and purity (no pesticides, no heavy metals, no B.S.), and made in FDA- and GMP-compliant facilities. Translation: clean, powerful, and proven. |
| 32 | The Bottom Line: I Feel Really Good |
| 33 | These days, my energy is steady, my digestion is on track, and my brain fog is a thing of the past. Plus, the gummy bear format is fun, easy to take, and kind of delicious (sweet, slightly earthy, and not at all fake). |

| 119 | Wow! |
| 120 | I now take time to make up my face again every day! |
| 121 | I had resigned to ‘plain Jane’ after retiring and the amount of time it took to get ready. I just wanted a fresh look but never could achieve that without the full face make up. This line has changed all of that. Literally ready to go with a natural fresh looking glow in five minutes. And products that are great for my skin. LOVE it! |

| 5 | How People of All Ages Are Finding Relief from Insomnia & Anxiety with This Natural Solution – Backed by Over 2,500 Verified Reviews. |
| 6 | Published on May 29, 2025 |
| 7 | If you have ever wondered if there was a natural safe solution to help ease anxiety calm your nerves and sleep better, then you need to read this real life story. |
| 8 | 1. A Natural Solution That Works |
| 9 | (Without Breaking The Bank) |
| 10 | Sleep and anxiety medications can cost hundreds each month and often lose effectiveness over time. |
| 11 | CalmCarry is a one-time investment that you can simply recharge and continue using for years. |
| 12 | It is 100% natural and safe, eliminating the ongoing expense of prescriptions or supplements. |
| 13 | Users report saving over $1,200 annually on sleep aids while experiencing better results naturally. |
| 14 | 2. Highly Effective, Scientifically Proven & Loved by Thousands |
| 15 | CalmCarry isn't just another trendy device. It works by gently stimulating the PC8 point (also known as the "Palace of Peace" or Lao Gong point) - a powerful relaxation center located in the palm of the hand. |
| 16 | For over 1,000 years, Chinese medicine has recognized this point as a gateway to calming the entire body's nervous system, much like pressing a natural "reset button" for stress and anxiety. |
| 17 | When this remarkable point is stimulated by CalmCarry's gentle micro-pulses, it triggers the body's own relaxation response. |
| 18 | Think of it like having a calming ripple effect that spreads from your palm throughout your entire body. |
| 19 | Clinical studies show this natural approach helps 92% of users sleep better and 87% experience reduced anxiety. The technology is completely safe, with no nausea or harmful EMF emissions. |
| 20 | Just look at what real CalmCarry users are saying: |
| 21 | 3. No side effects or risk of dependency. |

| 33 | So how does the CalmCarry work and why is it so effective? |
| 34 | CalmCarry uses precise micro-current technology to gently stimulate the PC8 acupressure point in the palm. This special point has been known in Chinese medicine for over 1000 years as a gateway to calming the body's stress response. When stimulated correctly, it triggers the body's natural relaxation response, helping quiet racing thoughts and ease anxiety. |
| 35 | Think of it like pressing a 'reset' button for the nervous system. The gentle pulses, which feel like soft, rhythmic waves in the palm, work with your body's natural systems to promote calmness and relaxation. Users often describe the sensation as deeply soothing - similar to a gentle hand massage. |
| 36 | Why CalmCarry Works So Well Against Insomnia & Anxiety |

| 3 | Get Yours Before the Sell Out 👉 (support 🇺🇸 small business) |
| 4 | 150,000 Happy Sleepers |
| 5 | Wake up rested and ready to win |
| 6 | Backed by experts and real results |
| 7 | Simple habit that transforms how you wake up |
| 8 | 82% Reported snoring less within the first 3 nights. |
| 10 | 91% Said they felt more rested after 1 week. |
| 12 | 51 Million Mouth Tapes Sold |
| 14 | 1. You’re Mouth Breathing All Night |
| 15 | Every time your mouth falls open, oxygen levels drop and deep sleep disappears. |
| 16 | That’s why you wake up exhausted no matter how long you slept. |
| 17 | → Keep reading to see what happens when you fix your breathing. |
| 18 | 2. Snoring Is the Sound of Your Body Suffocating |
| 19 | It’s not just noise, it’s a sign your airway is collapsing. |
| 20 | Your brain wakes you up over and over to survive the night. |
| 21 | → The result? You never hit real recovery sleep. |
| 22 | 3. Your Sleep Quality Dropped - Even At 8 Hours |
| 23 | You’re still getting “8 hours,” but not the right kind. |
| 24 | Mouth breathing short-circuits REM and recovery cycles. |
| 25 | → You’re sleeping, but not restoring. |
| 26 | 4. Bad Sleep is Killing Your Energy and Focus |
| 27 | When you breathe wrong, your testosterone, metabolism, and mood all tank. |
| 28 | That’s why you’re sluggish, irritable, and unmotivated. |
| 29 | → Fix your breathing and your drive comes back. |
| 30 | 5. It’s Wrecking Your Relationship |
| 31 | You’re tired, she’s annoyed, and you’re both miserable. |
| 32 | Snoring leads to resentment and “sleep divorce” is real. |
| 33 | → But couples who fix their breathing get their bed (and peace) back. |
| 34 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Terry B., 35 |
| 35 | “My wife finally sleeps through the night. We’re back in the same room again.” |
| 36 | 6. Hostage Tape Fixes the Problem Naturally |
| 37 | It gently seals your lips so you breathe through your nose all night. No machines. No mouth guards. No noise. |
| 38 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Brian H., 41 |
| 39 | “I was skeptical, but I woke up clear-headed after the first night.” |
| 40 | → The fix is smaller (and simpler) than you think. |
| 41 | 7. Is Mouth Taping Safe? |
| 42 | Yes, if you can breathe through your nose when lying down, it's safe to mouth tape. |
| 43 | If you can't breathe through your nose, don't. |
| 44 | You also want to use proper tape made for sleep. |
| 45 | Hostage Tape is medical-grade, breathable, and skin- safe. It’s designed to seal gently and be breathable, allowing your body’s natural reflexes to stay intact. |
| 46 | Science behind it: |
| 47 |  |
| 48 | Human breathing reflexes are automatic; if nasal airflow drops, the brain triggers mouth opening or awakening. |
| 49 | 8. What If My Nose Gets Stuffy or I Have Allergies? |
| 50 | If you can breathe through your nose during the day, you can usually tape safely at night. |
| 51 | Allergies or congestion can make nasal breathing harder, but nasal breathing itself improves sinus health by increasing airflow and nitric oxide production. |
| 52 | Use a saline rinse or nasal dilator if needed. |
| 53 | Science behind it: |
| 55 | Nitric oxide has antimicrobial and anti- inflammatory effects that reduce swelling in nasal tissue. |
| 57 | Consistent nasal airflow trains the nasal turbinates to stay open longer, improving long- term breathing capacity. |
| 58 | 9. Could I Suffocate in My Sleep? |
| 59 | No. Your body has powerful safety reflexes that prevent that. |
| 60 | If your nasal passage becomes blocked, you will automatically open your mouth or wake up. |
| 61 | Hostage Tape is breathable and designed to peel off if needed. |
| 62 | Science behind it: |
| 63 |  |
| 64 | The brain’s medulla oblongata monitors blood CO₂ levels and triggers arousal or mouth opening if oxygen levels fall. |
| 65 |  |
| 66 | Research shows these protective reflexes activate long before oxygen levels reach danger zones. |
| 67 | 10. It’s Safe, Beard-Friendly, and Doctor-Approved |
| 68 | Made with medical-grade adhesive and porous design. Endorsed by dentists, ENTs, and sleep specialists nationwide. |
| 69 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Dr. Alfi |
| 70 | “I’m a jaw surgeon and dentist, and I use Hostage Tape myself. It’s safe, effective, and changes lives.” |
| 71 | → Safe enough for nightly use, strong enough to work. |
| 72 | Why Can't I Just Use Regular Tape? |
| 73 | Because regular tape isn’t made for skin or the dynamic movement of your lips. |
| 74 | Medical or athletic tape can |
| 75 | irritate skin, pull hair, or |
| 76 | trap heat and moisture |
| 77 | especially for men with facial |
| 78 | hair. |
| 79 | Those random Amazon brands often use industrial adhesives, non-sterile factories, and zero quality control. |
| 80 | No refund policy. No guarantee. No traceability. |
| 81 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Ryan P., 42 |
| 82 | “The cheap Amazon ones burned my skin. Hostage Tape just works.” |
| 83 | You’ll Feel the Change Overnight |
| 84 | Most guys notice the difference on night one. |
| 85 | You’ll wake up calm, clear, and actually rested. |
| 86 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Eric W., 35 |
| 87 | “Felt like I slept 10 hours after just one night. Unreal.” |
| 88 | → Tomorrow morning could be your reset. |
| 89 | It’s Risk-Free To Try |
| 90 | 30-night money-back promise. |
| 91 | Free shipping. HSA/FSA eligible. |
| 92 | No gimmicks, just better sleep. |
| 93 | → The only thing you risk is another bad morning. |
| 94 | Tired Isn’t Normal |
| 95 | Hostage Tape helps you sleep deeper, snore less, and actually feel like yourself again. |
| 96 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Mike P., 43 |
| 97 | “I’m 43 and feel 10 years younger. Can’t believe something this simple fixed it.” |
| 98 | → The men who try it once never sleep without it again. |

What a great idea. I wish I’d known about it long time ago, I feel like a lot of people are afraid To give it a try. I think they are worried that they’ll feel claustrophobic, but that’s not the case. |

I tried them on the recommendation from my brother-in-law that swore they were the only thing that helped him sleep better, even over his CPAP. I can not more highly recommend this product, I do so cute and ages. |

| 202 | My son has been using Hostage tape for about 4 months now while sleeping. He’s a mouth breather at night and he reports that the tape gives him a much better nights sleep and he feels much more rested in the mornings. I have no problem getting him to use it every night because he loves it. We had also researched how to help him with his weak jawline and, as you can see, in only 4 months of mouth taping we are thrilled with the results! I would recommend this tape for anyone who wants to get ... |

| 15 | Who is Dr. Alfi... |
| 16 | 1. What is Mouth Taping? |
| 17 | Mouth taping is a simple way to help your body do what it was designed to do, breathe through your nose while you sleep. |
| 18 | When your mouth stays closed, your tongue sits against the roof of your mouth, which helps keep your airway open and stable. |
| 19 | This position improves oxygen exchange in your lungs and reduces airway collapse, leading to deeper, quieter sleep and more consistent oxygen levels through the night. |
| 20 | Science behind it: |
| 21 |  |
| 22 | Nasal breathing increases nitric oxide, which improves oxygen absorption in the bloodstream. |
| 23 |  |
| 24 | Mouth breathing causes excess carbon dioxide loss, disrupting the body’s balance and sleep stability. |
| 25 | 2. Is Mouth Taping Safe? |
| 26 | Yes, if you can breathe through your nose when lying down, it's safe to mouth tape. |
| 27 | If you can't breathe through your nose, don't. |
| 28 | You also want to use proper tape made for sleep. |
| 29 | Hostage Tape is medical-grade, breathable, and skin- safe. It’s designed to seal gently and be breathable, allowing your body’s natural reflexes to stay intact. |
| 30 | Science behind it: |
| 31 |  |
| 32 | Human breathing reflexes are automatic; if nasal airflow drops, the brain triggers mouth opening or awakening. |
| 33 | 3. What If My Nose Gets Stuffy or I Have Allergies? |
| 34 | If you can breathe through your nose during the day, you can usually tape safely at night. |
| 35 | Allergies or congestion can make nasal breathing harder, but nasal breathing itself improves sinus health by increasing airflow and nitric oxide production. |
| 36 | Use a saline rinse or nasal dilator if needed. |
| 37 | Science behind it: |
| 38 |  |
| 39 | Nitric oxide has antimicrobial and anti- inflammatory effects that reduce swelling in nasal tissue. |
| 40 |  |
| 41 | Consistent nasal airflow trains the nasal turbinates to stay open longer, improving long- term breathing capacity. |
| 42 | 4. Could I Suffocate in My Sleep? |
| 43 | No. Your body has powerful safety reflexes that prevent that. |
| 44 | If your nasal passage becomes blocked, you will automatically open your mouth or wake up. |
| 45 | Hostage Tape is breathable and designed to peel off if needed. |
| 46 | Science behind it: |
| 47 |  |
| 48 | The brain’s medulla oblongata monitors blood CO₂ levels and triggers arousal or mouth opening if oxygen levels fall. |
| 49 |  |
| 50 | Research shows these protective reflexes activate long before oxygen levels reach danger zones. |
| 51 | 5. Why Can't I Just Use Regular Tape? |
| 52 | Because regular tape isn’t made for skin or the dynamic movement of your lips. |
| 53 | Medical or athletic tape can |
| 54 | irritate skin, pull hair, or |
| 55 | trap heat and moisture |
| 56 | especially for men with facial |
| 57 | hair. |
| 58 | Those random Amazon brands often use industrial adhesives, non-sterile factories, and zero quality control. |
| 59 | No refund policy. No guarantee. No traceability. |
| 60 | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Ryan P., 42 |
| 61 | “The cheap Amazon ones burned my skin. Hostage Tape just works.” |
| 62 | 6. Why Does Nasal Breathing Matter so Much? |
| 63 | Your nose is a built-in air filter and oxygen optimizer. |
| 64 | When air passes through it, it’s cleaned, humidified, and warmed to protect the lungs. |
| 65 | Even more important, your sinuses release nitric oxide, which boosts oxygen transfer in your blood, supports cardiovascular health, and even helps fight bacteria and viruses. |
| 66 | Science behind it: |
| 67 |  |
| 68 | Nitric oxide acts as a vasodilator, improving oxygen delivery to cells and tissues. |
| 69 |  |
| 70 | Nasal breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering stress hormones and heart rate. |
| 71 | 7. Can it Help Stop Snoring? |
| 72 | For many people, yes. Snoring happens when air flows through an open mouth and vibrates the soft palate and tissues in the throat. |
| 73 | When you breathe through your nose, air travels more smoothly and quietly, reducing vibration and turbulence. |
| 74 | Science behind it: |
| 75 |  |
| 76 | Studies show nasal breathing lowers “upper airway resistance,” reducing vibration amplitude in the soft palate. |
| 77 |  |
| 78 | Keeping the mouth closed and tongue in its natural nasal posture prevents airway collapse, a common cause of snoring. |
| 79 | 8. Does Mouth Taping Improve Sleep Quality? |
| 80 | Yes. When you breathe through your nose, your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels stay balanced. |
| 81 | This balance tells your brain it’s safe to stay in deep, restorative sleep. |
| 82 | Mouth breathing, on the other hand, leads to over- breathing, oxygen imbalance, and triggers your body’s fight-or-flight stress response. |
| 83 | Science behind it: |
| 84 |  |
| 85 | Proper carbon dioxide retention supports the Bohr effect, which controls how oxygen is released into your tissues. |
| 86 |  |
| 87 | Balanced CO₂ and O₂ levels help maintain longer periods of slow-wave and REM sleep. |
| 88 | 9. What If I Have a Beard or Sensitive Skin? |
| 89 | That’s exactly what Hostage Tape was designed for. |
| 90 | Traditional tapes can pull, irritate, or leave residue. |
| 91 | Hostage Tape uses a soft, medical-grade adhesive that stays on all night but removes cleanly in the morning, even over thick facial hair. |
| 92 | Science behind it: |
| 93 |  |
| 94 | The tape’s adhesive is hypoallergenic preventing trauma or inflammation. |
| 95 |  |
| 96 | Its breathable structure prevents heat and moisture buildup that can irritate skin. |
| 97 |  |
| 98 | And because it’s flexible and adaptive, it stays securely in place even on uneven or bearded surfaces, moving naturally with your face as you sleep. |
| 99 | 10. What Kind of Results Can I Expect? |
| 100 | Most people notice results within a few nights: |
| 101 |  |
| 102 | Less snoring |
| 103 |  |
| 104 | No more dry mouth |
| 105 |  |
| 106 | Deeper sleep |
| 107 |  |
| 108 | More energy and focus |
| 109 | Over time, you retrain your body to breathe correctly, improve oxygen efficiency, and strengthen your nasal passages. |
| 110 | This leads to higher daytime alertness, better heart rate variability, and improved recovery. |
| 111 | Science behind it: |
| 112 |  |
| 113 | Mouth taping improves oxygen saturation and reduces overnight heart rate variability fluctuations. |
| 114 |  |
| 115 | Balanced breathing during sleep enhances autonomic recovery and supports metabolic health. |
| 116 | How Should I Start? |
| 117 | If you feel anxious, start slow. Try wearing the tape for 20 to 30 minutes while watching TV or reading before bed. |
| 118 | Once it feels natural, use it overnight. Clean, dry skin helps it seal properly. |
| 119 | Science behind it: |
| 120 |  |
| 121 | Habit formation in breathing patterns takes repetition. Within a week, most people naturally maintain nasal breathing during sleep without awareness. |
| 122 |  |
| 123 | Gradual exposure helps desensitize the brain’s initial “foreign object” response. |

| 112 | I was a terrible flosser before. I brushed twice and flossed twice a week if that. Now that I discovered Flaus, I floss every day sometimes more than once. It is so much more comfortable and easier than traditional flossing. And I have arthritis so this is a game changer for me. I feel more confident smiling now knowing that my teeth look better. |
